#### Less Code Using Double Dot, The Cascade Operator 
- Dart has a single dot (.) operator. And a few minutes ago, we talked about three dots (â€¦) .
- So, one and three dots are covered. 
- Do you feel like anything missing in the middle? You got it correctly. We are talking about the middle person, the double dot (..) which is also known as the cascadeoperator.
- You can use the cascade operator to save typing time when multiple method calls on the same object are being made.
